I am all about computational and experimental mechanics. 

Why both? Because they appear together in today's engineering problems. 

Take FEA and DIC, for example. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of products that leverage modern materials (like polymers or composites) require non-linear and anisotropic constitutive laws to fully characterize them. Here's where advanced experimental techniques are needed. Techniques like Digital Image Correlation (DIC) measure deformation and strain fields of highly-deformable and highly-anistropic materials. But, DIC does not measure strain directly. It uses the same computational mechanics principles to indirectly measure strain from the point cloud it does measure.

In sum, a good experimentalist needs to understand computational mechanics. And a good analyst needs to understand experimental mechanics.
